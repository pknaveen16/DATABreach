Incident Analysis: Investigate how the breach occurred. Determine the point of entry, the extent of the breach, and the timeframe during which it occurred.
2. Forensic Analysis: Conduct digital forensics on the affected systems to identify any malware or suspicious activities. Collect evidence and logs.
3. Data Recovery: Determine the type and quantity of customer data that was potentially exposed. Develop a strategy for data recovery and incident containment.4. Regulatory Compliance: Consider the legal and regulatory aspects of the data breach and ensure that the company complies with reporting requirements.
5. Communication and Notification: Develop a communication plan for notifying affected customers, stakeholders, and regulatory bodies. Ensure that the communication is clear and in compliance with privacy laws.
6. Post-Incident Review: After the breach has been contained and mitigated, conduct a thorough review to identify weaknesses in the security posture and provide recommendations for improving security.

I created a bar graph showing the total number of incidents per breach in which HACK (Hacked by an Outside Party or Infected by Malware) is the type of breach with the highest number of reported incidents per my dataset.
