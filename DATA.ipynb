But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign\\u2019s list of customers and users.\\u201cAs part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,\\u201d DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. \\u201cA complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed. No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign\\u2019s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign\\u2019s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.\\u201dThe company is asking people to forward any suspicious emails related to DocuSign to spam@docusign.com, and then to delete the missives.\\u00a0\\u201cThey may appear suspicious because you don\\u2019t recognize the sender, weren\\u2019t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like \\u201cdocusgn.com\\u201d without an \\u2018i\\u2019 or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than https://www.docusign.com or https://www.docusign.net,\\u201d reads the advisory.If you have reason to expect a DocuSign document via email, don\\u2019t respond to an email that looks like it\\u2019s from DocuSign by clicking a link in the message. When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email. DocuSign says it will never ask recipients to open a PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email.DocuSign was already a perennial target for phishers and malware writers, but this incident is likely to intensify attacks against its users and customers.

In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn\\u2019t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we\\u2019ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he\\u2019d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address\\u00a0when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient\\u2019s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem. Molina also said it was trying to figure out how such a mistake was made, and if there was any evidence to suggest the Web site bug had been widely abused.\\u201cThe previously identified security issue has been remediated,\\u201d the company said. \\u201cBecause protecting our members\\u2019 information is of utmost importance to Molina and out of an abundance of caution, we are taking our ePortal temporarily offline to perform additional testing of our system security.

It was meant to be stored and shared anonymously, however such poor precautions were taken that deanonymising would not be hard.. . . .Facebook suspended myPersonality from its platform on 7 April saying the app may have violated its policies due to the language used in the app and on its website to describe how data is shared.More than 6 million people completed the tests on the myPersonality app and nearly half agreed to share data from their Facebook profiles with the project.
